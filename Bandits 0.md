I am excited to walk you through the challenges 😺

### Welcome to this Bandit Journey! --- Level 0 

This level is pretty easy! One command and you are good to go! 
We use ssh to connect to another server. 
`ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`

The instruction says we need to connect to port 2220. Here we use -p flag to do that. 
The password is also provided at this level (bandit0). You’ll be prompted for the password. Enter it and you’ll be logged in. 

do `ls -la` (the command we use to see what's inside the folder aka directory)
**we will need this command for almost bandit challenges.** 

You should be able to see a readme file. How do we read file in Linux? a cat! (meow)

`cat readme`

![bandit0 flag]([bandit0_flag.png)

copy the flag you see and we can move on to another level!
