Hello!  
Welcome to my collection of solutions, thoughts, and little brain-notes from the OverTheWire Bandit challenges.  

I’m going to assume you’re a newbie — the same way I was (and honestly… maybe still am).  
By “newbie,” I mean: you know how to open a terminal.  
And… that’s about it. Linux commands? Yeah, probably not your close friends yet.

Buckle up! We’re diving in, level by level. Let’s go!
